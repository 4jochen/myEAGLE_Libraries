# myEAGLE_Libraries
I share some eagle 9 libraries I created over the last 10 years and updated recently.
most important parts:

- eWBM:
  - MS500 SoC (100MHz ARM Cortex M0) with symmetric and asymetric hardware crypto engine + secure boot and secure storage features
  - sS2E secure Serial to Ethernet Module (MS500 + W5500) - THT version
  - eSE100 the smaller SMD version of the sS2E module

- WIZnet:
  - W5500 hardware TCP/IP Ethernet I/F chip = 3in1 (TCP/IP + MAC + PHY)
  - W5500-io mini module, also footprint and signal compatible with the W6100-io and W5100s-io module
    this modules are somtimes also called WIZ550io-mini or WIZ6100io-mini

- Taimag:
  - RJPLB-203TC1 a very nice RJ45 MagJack with PoE out
